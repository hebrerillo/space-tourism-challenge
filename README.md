# Space tourism website - A Frontend mentor challenge
Live Site URL: https://tourism-space-challenge.netlify.app/index.html

### Built with
- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox/Grid layouts
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Sass
- CSS3 transitions

### Layout
The layout is implemented from a Figma design with the following screen sizes:
- Mobile 375 x 667
- Tablet 768 x 1024
- Desktop 1440 x 900

What happens between those screen sizes is something entirely made up by me.

### The challenge
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information
